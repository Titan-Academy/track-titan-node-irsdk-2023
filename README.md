Unofficial [iRacing](http://www.iracing.com/) SDK implementation for NodeJS.

## DISCLAIMER
First of all I'm a self-taught coder and wouldn't call myself a developer as I have no educational background.

As I had various errors with the original repo [node-irsdk](https://github.com/apihlaja/node-irsdk) By Antti Pihlaja
and also several forks, I've tried to puzzle the barebones pieces together to get this version running, starting with
[node-irsdk-2021](https://github.com/mcalapurge/node-irsdk) By Nekaiko.
Still, kudos to all the developers, that have done all the hard work <3

So, this version works as of 30/12/2022 and NodeJS v18.12.1 LTS, with no prebuild and only the necessary dependencies to get it up and running, but at least no vulnerabilities, so that's good I guess.
Also there is none of the previous testing framework, so use at your own risk.

## prerequesites
For compiling this package you need `node-gyp@^9.0.0`.
```
npm install -g node-gyp
```
You also need a current version of `Python3` and `Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools` installed.
More information regarding the topic can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/n-api.html#building).
I haven't tried this myself (as I already had msbuild installed), but according to the documentation, you could easily run:
```
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```


## installing
```
npm install --save https://github.com/hmiefert/node-irsdk-2023
```

## starter projects
- [NodeJS starter project](https://github.com/hmiefert/irtelemetry)
- [ElectronJS starter project](https://github.com/hmiefert/electron-irtelemetry)

## using with electron
When using this package with electron, you might run into an error stating that the installed package was compiled against a different version of NodeJS, therefore the NODE_MODULE versions differ and you're expected to recompile the package.
To achieve this you need a package called electron-rebuild and run the rebuild command manually:
```
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild
.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
```
